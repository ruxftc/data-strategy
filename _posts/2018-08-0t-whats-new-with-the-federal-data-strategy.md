#What’s New with the Federal Data Strategy

In June, the Federal Data Strategy development team released a Request for Comments to gather input from federal agencies and the public to be used for the development of a Federal Data Strategy. Since then, we’ve made a lot of progress!

<ul>
<li>We’ve been *finalizing Principles for the Federal Data Strategy* based on feedback received on the [draft Principles](https://strategy.data.gov/strategy/) released in June, and we are planning to release the final Principles in October.</li>

<li>We’ve *created working groups* of Federal Data Fellows, which are centered around the [four areas of the data strategy](https://strategy.data.gov) and the [Data Incubator Project](https://strategy.data.gov/incubator/).</li>

<li>The working groups have collected and *analyzed input from a variety of sources* and are drafting Practices for the Federal Data Strategy and reviewing Use Cases for the Data Incubator. The draft Practices will be released in October for comment before they are finalized for January release.</li>
</ul>
