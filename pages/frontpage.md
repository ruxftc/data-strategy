## The Federal Data Strategy: Principles and Practices

The mission of the Federal Data Strategy is to fully leverage the value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good by guiding the Federal Government in practicing ethical governance, conscious design, and a learning culture. 

The use of data is transforming the world. The way the Federal Government provides, maintains, and uses data has a unique place in society, and maintaining trust in federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The Federal Government needs a coordinated and integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality. The Federal Data Strategy offers guidance on how agencies should manage and use federal data. The Principles and Practices provide a whole-of-government vision, while yearly Action Plans identify concrete steps for agencies to undertake to achieve this long-term vision. In addition, the Data Incubator Project will highlight specific examples, use cases and methods that might be replicated or scaled.

The Federal Data Strategy consists of Principles  and Practices  to leverage the value of the entire Federal Government data asset portfolio while protecting security, privacy, and confidentiality. The [principles](https://strategy.data.gov/principles/) and [practices](https://strategy.data.gov/practices/) deliver a more consistent approach to federal data stewardship, use, and access. The principles are a timeless, enduring framework for agencies, while the practices are actionable, yet aspirational, goals for a 5- to 10-year time horizon. The principles and practices were revised based on comments received from the public.

The Federal Data Strategy development team will create a Year 1 Action Plan to identify practice-related action steps that are the priority for the year, along with targeted timeframes for implementation and responsible assignments. The Draft Year 1 Action Plan is now available for public comment. Once public feedback is incorporated, a revised version will be released later in 2019.

## Why create a Federal Data Strategy?

In March of 2018, the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) laid out a new [Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html) to develop and implement a comprehensive Federal Data Strategy. Over the course of the next year, with input from the full spectrum of government and non-government stakeholders, the first government-wide data strategy will be developed, along with plans for implementation.
## Who is developing the Federal Data Strategy?

In short, we all are. While the [CAP goal co-leads](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html) and development team are managing the project, the Federal Data Strategy will be built on the expertise and input of those who contribute ideas, examples, comments, and suggestions. If you have any, this is the place to share them.

## How will the Federal Data Strategy be developed?

The Federal Data Strategy will be developed iteratively in four steps, and after each step we will make the findings public and ask for your feedback and input. The strategy will be developed around four topical areas. The Federal Data Strategy development team will pull together a comprehensive strategy from the input and insights contributed by stakeholders. Stay tuned to [strategy.data.gov](https://strategy.data.gov) to keep up to date and ensure we hear from you.
